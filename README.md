# Working-With-Classical-ML
## ML Models included:
1.Linear Regression:
  -Used for predicting a continuous, numerical target variable.
  -Assumes a linear relationship between the features and the target variable.
  -Simple and interpretable, but may not perform well with non-linear relationships.
  
2.Logistic Regression:
  -Used for binary classification problems (e.g., yes/no, true/false).
  -Models the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class.
  -Extends linear regression to handle categorical target variables.
  
3.Decision Tree:
  -Can be used for both classification and regression tasks.
  -Builds a tree-like model by recursively splitting the data based on the features.
  -Handles non-linear relationships and feature interactions.
  -Can be easily interpreted, but may suffer from overfitting on certain datasets.
  
4.Random Forest:
  -An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees.
  -Trains multiple decision trees on random subsets of the data and features.
  -Reduces overfitting tendencies of individual decision trees.
  -Generally provides better performance and robustness compared to a single decision tree.
